note:
  What?
  -> MonogoDB is NoSQL Database
  -> Humongous
  -> Because it can store lots and lots of data
  -> MongoDB is looks like JSON (BSON) Data Format
    => Example:
        {
          "name": "Fresly",
          "age": 26,
          "address": {
            "city": "Bekasi"
          },
          "hobbies": [
            { "name": "Cooking" },
            { "name": "Sports" }
          ]
        }
