note:
  Dynamic Routing:
    - You can pass dynamic path segments by adding a ":" to the Express router path
    - The name you add after ":" is the name by which you can extract the data on req.params
    - Optional (query) parameters can also be passed (?param=value&b=2) and extracted (req.query.myParam)

  More on Models:
    - A Cart model was added - it holds static methods only
    - You can interact between models (e.g. delete cart item if a product is deleted)
    - Working with files for data storage is suboptimal for bigger amounts of data
