npm:

how to:

note:
    npm:
        - npm init
        - can be defined package.json file to give you shortcut common tasks/commands

    3rd party packages:
        - install via npm (npm install <name-package>)
        - differentiate production dependencies (--save), development dependencies (--save-dev) and global dependencies (-g)

    types of errors:
        - syntax, runtime, logical errors can break app
        - syntax, runtime errors thrown (helpful) erorr messages (with line numbers)
        - logical errors can be fixed with testing and the help of the debugger
    debuggings:
        - use vscode node debugger to step into your code and go through step-by-step
        - analyze variables values at runtime
        - look into (and manipulate) variables at runtime
        - set breakpoints cleverly (i.e. respect async/event-driven nature)
