note:
	SQL:
		- SQL uses strict data schemas and relations
		- You can connect your Node.js app via packages like mysql2
		- Writing SQL queries is not directly related to Node.js and something you have to learn in addition to Node.js

	Sequelize:
		- Instead of writing SQL queries manually, you can use packages (ORMs) like Sequelize to focus on the Node.js code and work with native JS objects
		- Sequelize allows you define models and interact with the database through them
		- You can also easily set up relations ("Associations") and interact with your related models through them
