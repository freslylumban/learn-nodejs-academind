note:
  Separation of Concern of MVC:
  - Models
    - Represents your data in your code
    - Work with your data (e.g. save, fetch)

  - Views
    - What the users sees
    - Decoupled for your application command

  - Controllers  ==>  Routes
    - Connecting your Models and your Views
    - Contains the "in-between" logic
