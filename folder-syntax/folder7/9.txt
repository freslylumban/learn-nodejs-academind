note:
  - Model
      - Responsible for representing your data
      - Responsible for managing your data (saving, fetching, ...)
      - Does not matter if you manage data in memory, files, databases
      - Contains data-related logic

  - View
      - What the user sees
      - Should not contain to much logic

  - Controller
      - Connects Model and View
      - Should only make sure that the two can communicate (in both directions)
