note:
  SQL vs NoSQL
  - Goal: Store Data and Make it Easily Accessible
  -> Use a Database!  (Quicker Access than with a File)
    -> SQL Databases  (e.g. MySQL)
    -> NoSQL Databases  (e.g. MongoDB)

  NoSQL:
    -> Tables in NoSQL called COLLECTIONS
    -> Records in NoSQL called DOCUMENTS
      => Data Schema no fit!
      => NoSQL have no Data Relations, but it's called Duplicated Data (Populate Data)
    -> Core NoSQL Databases Characteristics
      => NO Data Schema => No Structure required!
      => NO Data Relations
