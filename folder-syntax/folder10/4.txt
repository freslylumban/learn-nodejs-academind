note:
  SQL vs NoSQL
  - Goal: Store Data and Make it Easily Accessible
  -> Use a Database!  (Quicker Access than with a File)
    -> SQL Databases  (e.g. MySQL)
    -> NoSQL Databases  (e.g. MongoDB)

  -> Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
    -> Horizontal
      - Add More Server (and merge Data into one Database)

    -> Vertical
      - Improve Server Capacity / Hardware

  -> SQL
    - Data uses Schemas
    - Relations
    - Data is distributed across multiple tables
    - Horizontal scaling is difficult / impossible;
      Vertical scaling is possible
    - Limitations for lots of (thousands) read & write queries per second

  -> NoSQL
    - Schema-less
    - No (or very lov) Relations
    - Data is typically merged / nested in a few collections
    - Both horizontal and vertical scaling is possible
    - Great performance for mass read & write requests
