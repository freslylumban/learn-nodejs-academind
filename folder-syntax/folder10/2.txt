  SQL vs NoSQL
  - Goal: Store Data and Make it Easily Accessible
  -> Use a Database!  (Quicker Access than with a File)
    -> SQL Databases  (e.g. MySQL)
    -> NoSQL Databases  (e.g. MongoDB)

  SQL:
    -> Tables: Users, Products, Orders
      - each table have fields or columns
      - records: basically the rows in our tables
    -> Core SQL Databases Characteristics
      - Data Schema => All Data (in a Table) has to fit!
      - Data Relations => Tables are connected
        => One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many
    -> SQL Queries
      => SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 28
        SQL Keywords / Syntax such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE
        Parameters / Data such as *, users, age > 28
